            <p>
      	      In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly
      	      protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to
      	      the Constitution. This constitutional right of free speech only
      	      prevents <em>government restrictions</em> on speech, not
      	      restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless
      	      they are governmental institutions acting on behalf of the
      	      government.
            </p>
            <p>
      	      Many laws exist to restrict the ability of private businesses and
      	      individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment
      	      laws that restrict employers' ability to prevent employees from
      	      disclosing their salary with coworkers or attempting to organize a
      	      labor union. <em>These laws are not the First Amendment</em> and
      	      these protections are not imposed by the First Amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, if you're not in jail or being arrested, then your
              First Amendment freedom of speech is probably not being infringed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Does this mean you can say anything you want? Anything at all? Well,
              <a href="http://www.renegademothering.com/2017/02/22/internet-free-speech/">sort of</a>.
              You see, I have the right to free speech too, and I can tell you to
              get stuffed, or kick you out of my store for acting like an ass.
            </p>
            <h3>The right to free speech does not mean a freedom from consequence.</h3>
